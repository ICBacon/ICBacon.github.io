title: What My Notebook About Field Equations Taught Me
---


I created a Jupyter notebook about [{{site.data.mynotebooks[0].description}}]({{site.data.mynotebooks[0].url}}) from a course in Real Analysis that I had taken last fall. This mini project allowed me to use what I learned in Markdown this past week from Tony to write about something. I chose to write about a topic in mathematics because math is something that I have enjoyed since I was really young.  Along the way, I also discovered how to use Latek in Ipython, using gists to view notebooks on NBViewer, and how to use YAML to create a link to any notebooks that I want to add onto a website.
